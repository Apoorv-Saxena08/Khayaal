Usage Tips:
Lighter versions are great for backgrounds, hover states, or subtle accents where you want the color to be present but not overpowering.

Darker versions can be used for text, buttons, or elements you want to stand out more prominently, ensuring high contrast with lighter backgrounds.

This approach ensures that each color can be used effectively in different parts of your design, whether you want to add depth, highlights, or background elements to your food redistribution website.

fonts --------------------
Final Suggestions:
Primary Font for Body Text: Roboto, Open Sans, or Lato. These fonts are all modern, neutral, and perfect for content-heavy pages.

Font for Headings: Montserrat, Playfair Display, or Poppins. These fonts will provide a strong contrast to the body text and draw attention to important elements like titles and calls-to-action.
